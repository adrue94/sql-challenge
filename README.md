# README for Week 9 SQL Challenge

<p> Had a lot of trouble applying material from class; a lot of concepts that needed revision before I could apply it to the homework. The material itself was pretty straightforward but the idea of applying a PK / CK to each table felt unwieldly, counterintuitive. Similarly the dependencies (one-to-many vs. many-to-one) was a bit of a headscratcher. <br> 
Having to sort out dependencies before making tables added to the cumbersome feeling. </p>

<p> Had no problem joining tables to show specific data, though did wonder when *not* to apply "NOT NULL"; seemed ubiquitous. Also wasn't sure if VARCHAR was an appropriate datatype for the majority of columns.</p>
